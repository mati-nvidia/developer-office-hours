# NVIDIA Omniverse Developer Office Hour

This repository contains the sample extensions and scripts that I cover during the weekly Developer Office Hour livestreams. The livestreams take place every Friday at 10am (EST). Have a look at the [NVIDIA Omniverse Community Calendar](https://www.addevent.com/calendar/ae483892) to see when the next one will be. From AddEvent, you can add the events to your own calendar. The livestream recordings are also archived and with timestamped chapters for each question on the [NVIDIA Omniverse YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3jK4xNnlCVe61X_m5qcizysvP7HphjyU) and [NVIDIA On-Demand](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/search/?facet.mimetype[]=event%20session&layout=list&page=1&q=developer%20office%20hour&sort=date&sortDir=desc).


## How to navigate this repository
For every livestream date, there is a Kit extension that I worked from in `exts/maticodes.doh_YYYY_MM_DD`. If you go into one of those extension directories, you'll see a README with the questions answered on that date. You'll find code that I showed in the extension code itself and/or in the `scripts/` directory for that extension.
